# The-Herobrine-Update
A Minecraft Java Edition 1.16.5 Forge mod that adds some new things, including Herobrine.

Minecraft: The Herobrine Update.
This is an unofficial Minecraft "update" that we here at Watermelon Modders made.
Basiclly, there are "Ancient" books refering to an in-game history that we are making. In the books, there is a third dimension refered to as "The Lyre". The Lyre is the dimension that Herobrine escaped to after he lost the first two big "wars".
The Lyre Portal frame is made by finding a rare biome we made. It's called "The Lye". No, that isn't a typo. :) The Lye is a rare biome with the surface made of a block we created called Bluestone. All you have to do is mine a bunch of bluestone, and make a nether-like frame made of bluestone, then use the item called "The Lyres Portal Lighter" and use it get into The Lyre. Bluestone can only be obtained by using an iron pickaxe or better.

We haven't yet made Herobrine's Castle yet, till then, explore some of the many items and blocks we've made.
This mod is only compatible with Forge for Minecraft 1.16.5.

Thanks to MCreator for helping us make this mod.
